TODO for podload

* some kind of gui for editing the configs
** clojurescript? web based front-end?
* print a few example times for each podcast when loading configs
** i.e.
   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (take 10 (c/times-for some-spec-map (t/now)))
   #+END_SRC
* some way to dynamically add/remove configs from the queue
** i.e. based on
   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (seq (.getQueue executor))
   #+END_SRC
